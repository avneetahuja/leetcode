# Binary Tree Postorder Traversal üå≥

## Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodes' values.

## Approach üõ†Ô∏è

The solution employs a recursive approach to perform a postorder traversal of the binary tree.

1. Initialize an empty list (`res`) to store the postorder traversal result.
2. Define a recursive function `postOrder` that takes a node as input and performs the following:
   - If the node is `None`, return.
   - Recursively call `postOrder` on the left subtree of the current node.
   - Recursively call `postOrder` on the right subtree of the current node.
   - Append the value of the current node to the `res` list.
3. Call the `postOrder` function with the root of the binary tree.
4. Return the `res` list containing the postorder traversal result.

## Complexity Analysis ‚öôÔ∏è

- Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree.
  - The solution visits each node exactly once during the postorder traversal.
- Space Complexity: O(H), where H is the height of the binary tree.
  - The space used by the recursive call stack is proportional to the height of the tree.
