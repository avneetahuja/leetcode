# Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II üìà

## Problem Statement

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

## Approach üìà

This problem can be solved using a dynamic programming approach. We can define a function `f(i, canBuy)` that represents the maximum profit that can be achieved by day `i` with the option to buy (`canBuy` is 1) or sell (`canBuy` is 0).

### Steps:
1. Initialize a 2D array `t` to store the results of subproblems. Set all entries to -1 to indicate that the result is not yet calculated.
2. Define the recursive function `f(i, canBuy)` that calculates the maximum profit by considering the options to buy or sell on day `i`.
   - If `canBuy` is 1 (allowed to buy), update `t[i][canBuy]` by taking the maximum of either buying on day `i` and proceeding to the next day without buying or skipping the purchase on day `i` and moving to the next day with the option to buy.
   - If `canBuy` is 0 (allowed to sell), update `t[i][canBuy]` by taking the maximum of either selling on day `i` and proceeding to the next day with the option to buy or skipping the sale on day `i` and moving to the next day without buying.
3. Call the recursive function with the initial parameters `f(0, 1)` to start the process from the first day with the option to buy.
4. Return the result.

## Complexity Analysis ‚öôÔ∏è

- Time Complexity: O(n)
  - The recursive function is called once for each day, and the results are memoized in the 2D array.
- Space Complexity: O(n)
  - We use additional space for memoization in the 2D array.
