# Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock With Cooldown üìà

## Problem Statement

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

## Approach üìà

This problem can be solved using a dynamic programming approach. We can define a function `f(i, b)` that represents the maximum profit that can be achieved by day `i` with the option to buy or sell (`b` is 1 for buy, 0 for sell).

### Steps:
1. Initialize a 2D array `t` to store the results of subproblems. Set all entries to 0.
2. Define the recursive function `f(i, b)` that calculates the maximum profit by considering the options to buy or sell on day `i`.
   - If `b` is 1 (allowed to buy), update `t[i][b]` by taking the maximum of either buying on day `i` and proceeding to the next day without buying or skipping the purchase on day `i` and moving to the next day with the option to buy.
   - If `b` is 0 (allowed to sell), update `t[i][b]` by taking the maximum of either selling on day `i` and proceeding to the next day with the option to buy or skipping the sale on day `i` and moving to the next day without buying.
3. Call the recursive function with the initial parameters `f(0, 1)` to start the process from the first day with the option to buy.
4. Return the result.

## Complexity Analysis ‚öôÔ∏è

- Time Complexity: O(n)
  - The recursive function is called once for each day.
- Space Complexity: O(n)
  - We use additional space for memoization in the 2D array.
