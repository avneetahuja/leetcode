# Longest Subarray with Ones after Replacement

## Problem Statement

Given a binary array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array if you can flip at most `k` 0's.

## Approach üåü

We can use a sliding window approach to find the maximum length of consecutive 1's after replacing at most `k` 0's.

1. Initialize two pointers `l` and `r` to traverse the array `nums`.
2. Move the right pointer `r` until we reach the end of the array.
3. If `nums[r]` is 0, increment the count of zeros `current_count`.
4. If `current_count` is less than or equal to `k`, update the maximum length of consecutive 1's encountered so far.
5. If `current_count` exceeds `k`, move the left pointer `l` until the count of zeros `current_count` becomes less than or equal to `k`. This is done by incrementing `l` until `nums[l]` becomes 1.
6. Update the maximum length of consecutive 1's encountered so far.
7. Repeat steps 2-6 until the right pointer `r` reaches the end of the array.
8. Return the maximum length of consecutive 1's encountered.

## Complexity Analysis ‚öôÔ∏è

- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input array `nums`. Both the left and right pointers traverse the array at most once.
- Space Complexity: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra space.
